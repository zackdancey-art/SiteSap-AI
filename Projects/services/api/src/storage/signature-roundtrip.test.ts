/**
 * Postgres round-trip + integrity test for the inspection-signature feature
 * (Part 3). Signatures live in `inspection_signatures` (migration 024 §4): an
 * append-only, FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY table with a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that
 * makes signed content immutable and voiding one-way. None of that is
 * observable in the in-memory harness — `signature-store.test.ts` covers the
 * app-level logic, but the DB-level guarantees (the trigger, and RLS company
 * isolation) can ONLY be proven against real Postgres. This is that proof.
 *
 * It exercises, through the real store (`signatureStore.ts` /
 * `inspectionStore.ts`) and, where the guarantee is at the schema level, raw
 * SQL against Postgres:
 *   1. insert + read-back round-trips every field (status active, hash, snapshot)
 *   2. the trigger REJECTS an in-place edit of a signed column
 *   3. void is allowed once and is one-way — un-voiding is REJECTED by the trigger
 *   4. editing a signed inspection AUTO-VOIDS the stale signature; a status-only
 *      (non-content) edit does NOT
 *   5. RLS blocks cross-company reads
 *
 * RLS caveat (learned the hard way in the 024 smoke test): a role with
 * BYPASSRLS — which Neon's default `neondb_owner` has — bypasses the policy
 * entirely, so asserting isolation on the app's own connection would falsely
 * pass (or falsely fail). Test 5 therefore creates a dedicated NOBYPASSRLS
 * login role and runs the isolation assertions as THAT role, which is the only
 * way to genuinely prove the policy isolates. Red-on-revert: drop the policy
 * (or the table's FORCE) and test 5 goes red — the probe role starts seeing the
 * other company's rows.
 *
 * Guarded like `rls-integration.test.ts` / `incident-roundtrip.test.ts`:
 * without `TEST_DATABASE_URL` it registers one skipped placeholder and touches
 * no database. `useDatabase()` in both stores is test-aware, so with
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL set the Postgres branch runs, not the in-memory fallback.
