/**
 * RLS integration test for AUDIT.md finding H1 ("multi-tenancy is
 * convention-only" — company scoping was hand-written WHERE clauses with no
 * database-level backstop). Migrations 019-022 add Postgres Row-Level
 * Security to the tenanted tables; this is the only test in the suite that
 * can actually prove RLS works, because the rest of the suite runs against
 * the in-memory store fallback (DATABASE_URL="" under NODE_ENV=test — see
 * test-setup.ts) and never touches Postgres at all.
 *
 * Guarded: this test needs a real, disposable Postgres database. Without
 * `TEST_DATABASE_URL` set it registers a single skipped placeholder test and
 * does nothing else — no live DB connection is attempted. This is the
 * documented, intended behaviour for the sandbox this suite normally runs
 * in; it is expected to SKIP here.
 *
 * `getPgPool()` (storage/postgres.ts) already special-cases NODE_ENV==="test":
 * it connects using TEST_DATABASE_URL (never DATABASE_URL, even if a test
 * accidentally sets it), so we can call it directly with no extra plumbing.
 *
 * `incidents` is used as the RLS table under test — migration
 * 019_rls_incidents_reference.sql documents it as the reference/proof table
 * (ENABLE + FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, USING/WITH CHECK against
 * current_setting('app.company_id', true)); project_sites carries the same
 * policy shape as of migration 022.
