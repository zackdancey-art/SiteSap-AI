/**
 * Postgres round-trip regression test for the incident data-loss bug
 * documented in migration 024 (`024_incident_inspection_signatures.sql`,
 * "incidents — stop the data loss + WorkSafe NZ fields"): the incident form
 * has always collected fields (time, type, locationArea, injuredRole,
 * injuredEmployer, natureOfInjury, bodyPart, treatmentRequired, witnesses,
 * immediateActions, rootCause, reportedBy, supervisorNotified,
 * supervisorName, plus the newer WorkSafe NZ investigation fields) that the
 * API silently dropped on the way into Postgres — `createIncident`'s INSERT
 * simply never named those columns, so anything a field crew typed into
 * those inputs vanished on save with no error.
 *
 * This is the test whose absence let that bug survive: it saves an incident
 * with EVERY field populated through the real store (`incidentStore.ts`),
 * reads it back with a *separate* SELECT against Postgres (not just the
 * `RETURNING *` of the INSERT itself), and asserts every single field
 * round-trips unchanged — base fields, the pre-existing-but-dropped fields,
 * and the new WorkSafe JSONB fields (`contributingFactors`,
 * `correctiveActions`). If `createIncident`'s INSERT or `mapRow` drops or
 * mangles any field, exactly that field's assertion fails.
 *
 * Guarded like `rls-integration.test.ts`: this test needs a real, disposable
 * Postgres database. Without `TEST_DATABASE_URL` it registers a single
 * skipped placeholder and does nothing else — no live DB connection is
 * attempted. `incidentStore.ts`'s `useDatabase()` is test-aware: under
 * NODE_ENV=test it only picks the Postgres path when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is
 * set, so this test genuinely exercises `createIncident`/`listIncidents`'
 * database branch, not the in-memory fallback.
